Count Code
----------
For this warm-up we wrote a function that returns the number of times that the string "code" appears anywhere in a given string (such as long gibberish), except that it must also accept any letter for the "d" (so "cope" and "cooe" would also count as matches). We used the "match" method to accomplish this.
