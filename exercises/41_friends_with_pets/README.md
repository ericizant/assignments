Friends with Pets Props Practice
--------------------------------
Build a simple React app that has a '<FriendList />' component, a '<Friend />' component and a '<Pet />' component.

'.map()' through an array of friends. Each friend will have an array of pets. In your .map(), render a <Friend /> component, passing through the name, age, and pets of each friend as props.

'<Friend />' Should display the info nicely. Use some styles and appropriate HTML(JSX) tags. '<Friend />' should also '.map()' through the pets array and render '<Pet />.' '<Pet />' should also be displayed nicely.

Think about how you display strings, numbers, and arrays while building this app.
