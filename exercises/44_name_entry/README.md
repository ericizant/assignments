Name Entry
----------
Build a simple react app with an input box, an <h1> element, a 'submit' button, and an ordered list. The user will type names into the input box.

After the user types and submits a name in the input box, the <h1> element should update to show the same text as the input box.

When the user clicks the 'submit' button, the value of the input box should be added to a running list of names that have been previously entered (hint: to do this you'll need to set state and '.map()' over an array).
