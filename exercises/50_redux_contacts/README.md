Redux Contacts (Pure JS Redux)
------------------------------
Build a contact management system using Redux in a vanilla JavaScript environment (i.e., no React).

You should be able to dispatch actions that can add a new person and/or remove an existing person from an array of contacts.

The contact objects can have whatever properties you want. For example:

{
    name: "Tommy Oliver",
    phone: "925-867-5309",
    email: "thegreenranger@powerrangers.com"
}
