Blog Props
----------
A great way to practice building websites is to copy sites or apps that are already built. This exercise will help you fight through some of the harder aspects of web-design.

Re-create this website: "https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog/#"

You will organize it into these components:

<Header />
    <Navbar />
<BlogList />
    <BlogPost />
<Footer />

You should pass <BlogPost /> it's title, subtitle, author, and date through props.
