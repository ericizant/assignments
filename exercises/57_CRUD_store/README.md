CRUD Store
----------
This exercise is your first foray into implementing mongoose into your express server. You will be making a CRUD e-store inventory. Use postman to interface with all the items in your database.

Part One:

*Build a new server and connect it to mongodb.
*In a folder called 'models' create a file called 'inventory.js' and define an 'InventorySchema' for items in your store. Export the InventoryModel at the bottom of the file.

Part Two:

*Create a new folder called 'routes' containing a file named 'inventory.js'.
*Create all the necessary routes to make a full CRUD application (GET, GET(one), POST, PUT, DELETE).
*Populate your inventory using Postman. Be sure to test each endpoint.
