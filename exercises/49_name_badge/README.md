React Name Badge
----------------
Using React create a website that looks/works like this:

Requirements:

*The Input fields should NOT directly update the badge fields (which means that when you type in the input box you should NOT see the badge fields update immediately--only after the Submit button is pressed should the fields populate).
*Write code to make sure each field is not empty and has at least 3 characters.
*If any of the Input fields are empty the Submit button should also be disabled.
*Write validation code to make sure the phone number field contains only numbers (i.e., no dashes or special characters--it must look like this: 9757653323).

Optional:

*Store new name badges in an array and display them using .map. Each time you submit a new badge it should instantly appear in the list.
*Make the color of the badge heading background alternate on each list item (e.g., Red, Blue, Red, Blue--see the dynamic rendering write up more info).
