React Roto-Router
-----------------
For this exercise you will be making a mock SPA (Single Page Application) for a plumbing company website. The goal is to become proficient in using the three basic React-Router components: Link, Switch, and Route.

Your website must contain a Navbar, Footer, and a main View section. Your Navbar must contain at least three Link tags, each with a minimum of three different Views (for example: Home, About, and Services).
