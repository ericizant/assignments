Personal React/Redux Site
-------------------------
You are going to design and build your very own React/Redux site with a theme and content of your choosing.

This site will be a portfolio piece.

Requirements:

*Your site must integrate with an online API.
*Your site must have at least 3 views (linked pages) utilizing React Router.
*Your site must be responsive. You can choose any method to accomplish this that you like.
*One of the big challenges in accessing APIs is getting around the browser's "Same Origin Policy". Many of the APIs above require you to make requests from a server instead of the client. V School has built a small, simple request forwarder to help make this process easier. However, it may not work in all cases and should only be used if you know your API of choice doesn't allow front-end requests.

Check out the documentation for the request forwarder here: "https://coursework.vschool.io/v-school-request-forwarding-cors-documentation/"
