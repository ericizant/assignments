Final Project (Full-Stack Application)
--------------------------------------
Your indiviual final project is a self-directed, large-scale, full-stack applications that you'll be building over the remaining weeks of the course. Up to this point you've learned and practiced everything you need to know in order to build beautiful, data-driven web applications that can provide a real benefit to users. This will be a chance for you to continue to refine your skills and possibly build something that you could turn into a helpful tool for your friends and family, or maybe even a profitable business!

Project Requirements:

This project needs to be a full-stack web application. As such, it needs to satisfy the following set of requirements:

*A passed-off proposal explaining your app.
*Uses 'React' on the front-end.
*Is a single-page application (SPA).
*Is responsive.
*Is well organized, using 'Redux' and 'Axios' where applicable/useful.
*Uses 'Node.js'/'Express' as the back-end server.
*Shows a good understanding of module patterns by separating components, containers, etc., into their own folders and files.
*Uses 'Express' routers.
*Uses 'MongoDB' for the database and 'Mongoose' for schema creation and the ODM (Object-Document Mapper).
*Since we haven't spent much time learning it yet, your site does not need to include user authentication of any kind. However, you should certainly consider adding it to your application after we learn it!
*You also won't necessarily be required to integrate your site with a third-party API, but you should know that it is one of the best ways to make a really interesting and useful application in a short amount of time.

Proposal Requirements:

This part of the project is to help you narrow down your idea, clarify its parts, and make it easier to start coding.

*Paragraph describing your app idea: What are you building? Who is it for?
*An easily describable MVP. Remeber that you only have a limited amount of time to develop this project. What is the minimum you can get done on this project to meet the requirements and get a product into someone's hands?
*User Story: What is a user going to do when they go to your site from the moment they hit the landing page? What features do they need and which are optional?
*Wireframe: What is each page going to look like? What will be its layout, color scheme, etc?
*Mind Map: What is the structure of your back-end and front-end going to look like? What routes, models, components, actions, and reducers will you need? How will your data be organized?

Once you have the fulfill the requirements above you need to meet with your instructor and pass off your proposal before you begin coding.

Passing Criteria: Project Demo to the Class

You'll present your finished project to the rest of the class and spend a couple of minutes discussing in detail a difficulty (or two) you faced while developing your app and how you ended up solving that problem. The instructors/TAs will make sure your project satisfies all the requirements outlined above while you are presenting.
