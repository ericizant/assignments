Rock The Vote with DB
---------------------
You are going to create a website that allows users to post and upvote or downvote political issues.

Front-End Requirements:

*Use React for the front-end
*Web page that shows a list of political issues
*Each item will have a title
*Each item will have a description
*Each item can be upvoted or downvoted
*Items will be ordered by upvotes (with the most votes being at the top)
*Each item should show the total number of votes

Back-End Requirements:

You are going to finish your 'Rock the Vote' project by creating all needed Mongoose Schemas to be used in tandem with a MongoDB database. Now you can save people's data even after restarting the server!

*Use Node/Express and Mongoose/MongoDB for the back-end
*Your website will need the ability to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
*Website will have a 'Post' button that allows new posts
*Users can comment on posts (unlimited number of comments per post)

This is, more or less, a fully functional front-end and back-end application.
